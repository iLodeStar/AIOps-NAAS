## 🎯 Quick Start

### Option 1: For Developers (Manual Implementation)

```bash
# Step 1: Read the quick reference
cat ISSUE_V3_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

# Step 2: Reference main issue for detailed task specs
cat ISSUE_V3_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETION.md

# Step 3: Start with Task #1 (Critical Path)
cd services/anomaly-detection
# Follow specifications from main issue
```

### Option 2: For Copilot Agents (Autonomous)

```bash
# Copy this prompt and provide to Copilot:

Implement V3 Architecture completion following ISSUE_V3_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETION.md

CRITICAL PATH:
1. Refactor anomaly-detection to use aiops_core.models.AnomalyDetected
2. Create enrichment-service (Fast Path L1 enrichment)
3. Create correlation-service (incident formation)
4. Add V3 endpoints to incident-api

GUIDELINES:
- Use aiops_core.models for all data contracts
- Use aiops_core.utils.StructuredLogger for logging
- Preserve tracking_id throughout pipeline
- Test incrementally after each service
- Follow patterns from PR #156

SLO TARGETS:
- Fast Path: <100ms (99th percentile)
- Insight Path: <5s (99th percentile)

Begin with Task #1. Reference the full issue document for detailed specifications.
```

### Option 3: For Project Managers (Status Tracking)

```bash
# Check progress
cat ISSUE_V3_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

# Update checkboxes as tasks complete
# Review timeline in ISSUE_V3_INDEX.md
```
