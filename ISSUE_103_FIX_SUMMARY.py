Issue #103 Fix Summary and Validation

This script demonstrates the complete fix for the incident creation pipeline
that was showing "unknown", "0", or empty values instead of correct data.

📋 PROBLEM:
Incidents stored in ClickHouse were showing incorrect data:
- ship_id: "unknown-ship" instead of "ship-dhruv"  
- service: "unknown" instead of "rsyslogd"
- metric_value: 0 instead of 1.0
- anomaly_score: 0 instead of 0.8

🔍 ROOT CAUSE:
1. Benthos was not extracting hostname from metadata.source_host
2. Benthos was not extracting service from metadata.service
3. Incident API was checking existing ship_id before trying device registry
4. Device registry lookup was happening too late in the pipeline

✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
""")

    "1. Fixed Benthos mapping to extract metadata.source_host → host field",
