# ONBOARDING SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## 🎉 COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION DELIVERED

The AIOps Onboarding Service has been fully implemented according to all requirements in the problem statement.

### ✅ CORE REQUIREMENTS MET

**1. Complete Onboarding Service**
- ✅ FastAPI backend with OIDC (Keycloak) authentication using Auth Code Flow
- ✅ Session management with secure HMAC-signed tokens
- ✅ Role model: requester, deployer, authoriser, admin, viewer (mapped from OIDC claims)
- ✅ Two-level approval workflow requiring approvals from both deployer AND authoriser
- ✅ Requests cannot be executed until both approvals collected and OPA allows
- ✅ UI with Jinja2 templates for submit/view/approve/reject/execute
- ✅ Pagination, search, and status filters implemented
- ✅ SQLite for dev (default), PostgreSQL support via env DSN
- ✅ Database migrations via SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- ✅ REST endpoints for requests CRUD, approvals, execution trigger, audit retrieval
- ✅ Complete audit trail recording every state change with user, time, payload
- ✅ CSV/JSON audit export functionality
- ✅ Notification stubs (webhook/email logs) for state changes
- ✅ GitHub Actions dispatch via workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch
- ✅ OPA integration with comprehensive rego policies

**2. Two-Level Approver Policy**
- ✅ OPA rego policies requiring distinct users for deployer and authoriser
- ✅ Role presence validation from OIDC claims
- ✅ Environment-based rules (nonprod: permissive; production: enforcing with change windows)
- ✅ Service includes policy decision check before enabling Execute action

**3. Pre-Production Safe Overrides**
- ✅ Feature flags: DEPLOY_DRY_RUN, POLICY_MODE=permissive|enforcing, USE_MOCK_ACTIONS, CANARY_PERCENT
- ✅ Nonprod overlay enabling mocks and dry-run
- ✅ Production overlay enforcing full policy compliance

**4. CI and Tests**
- ✅ Unit tests for policy checks, RBAC, approval logic, API routes
- ✅ Integration/E2E tests simulating OIDC claims via test tokens
- ✅ Complete workflow: create→approve(deployer)→approve(authoriser)→execute(dry-run)
- ✅ Failure path testing included
- ✅ CI workflows for automated testing and coverage

**5. Documentation**
- ✅ Complete user guide for UI and API usage
- ✅ OIDC setup guide with Keycloak configuration examples
- ✅ Role mapping and approval workflow documentation
- ✅ Deployment trigger setup and configuration
- ✅ Production deployment guide with two-level approval coverage
- ✅ Pre-prod testing plan and safe-mode instructions
