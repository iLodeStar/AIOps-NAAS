# V3 Implementation - Quick Start Guide

**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**For**: Development Team  
**Epic**: ISSUE-20251003-142429-V3-COMPLETION

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Create All GitHub Issues
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/AIOps-NAAS/AIOps-NAAS/.github/issues
./create_all_issues.sh
```

This creates 14 issues in your repository automatically.

### Step 2: Review Execution Order
Read [V3_EXECUTION_ORDER.md](V3_EXECUTION_ORDER.md) for:
- Visual workflow diagrams
- Dependency relationships
- Team allocation strategies

### Step 3: Start Sprint 1
Begin with **Issue #1** (the only issue with no dependencies).

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint Overview

| Sprint | Week | Issues | Goal | Exit Criteria |
|--------|------|--------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Week 1 | #1-4 | Fast Path | E2E test <100ms |
| 2 | Week 2 | #5-7 | Insight Path | E2E test <5s |
| 3 | Week 3 | #8-11 | Infrastructure | Full observability |
| 4 | Week 4 | #12-14 | Quality | Production ready |

**Total Effort**: 32.5-37.5 hours (4 weeks)

## ðŸ”„ Execution Order (Simple View)

### Week 1: Critical Path (Must Be Sequential)
```
Day 1-2:  Issue #1 (2-3h) â†’ Issue #2 (4-5h)
Day 3-4:  Issue #3 (4-5h) â†’ Issue #4 (2-3h)
Day 5:    Testing & Integration
```

### Week 2: AI/ML (Parallel Possible)
```
Day 1:    Issue #6 (1h) + Issue #7 (1h) in PARALLEL
          Issue #10 (30m) - can also start
Day 2-3:  Issue #5 (4-5h) - needs #6 & #7 complete
Day 4-5:  Testing & Tuning
```

### Week 3: Infrastructure (Mixed)
```
Day 1:    Issue #8 (2h)
Day 2:    Issue #9 (2h)
Day 3-4:  Issue #11 (3h) - incremental across services
Day 5:    Testing & Documentation
```

### Week 4: Quality (Parallel Possible)
```
Day 1:    Issue #12 (1h) + Issue #14 (2h) in PARALLEL
Day 2-3:  Issue #13 (4h) - needs everything complete
Day 4:    Final Validation
```

## âš¡ Quick Reference

### Can Start Immediately (No Dependencies)
- Issue #1: Refactor anomaly-detection
- Issue #6: Add Ollama
- Issue #7: Add Qdrant
- Issue #10: Add tracking_id
- Issue #12: Cleanup legacy files

### Can Run in Parallel
- **Week 2**: #6 + #7 (both 1h)
- **Week 4**: #12 + #14 (1h + 2h)

### Must Wait (Have Dependencies)
- **#2-4**: Sequential chain (wait for previous)
- **#5**: Needs #6, #7, and #1-4 complete
- **#8**: Needs all services (#1-7)
- **#9**: Needs #8 (services running)
- **#11**: Needs #1 (pattern established)
- **#13**: Needs everything (#1-11)
- **#14**: Needs #4 (API endpoints)

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

### For Solo Developers
1. Follow the execution order strictly
2. Complete one issue per day (average 2-3h)
3. Test after each issue before moving on
4. Don't skip dependencies

### For Teams
1. Assign sprint leads per week
2. Use parallelization in Week 2 & 4
3. Daily standups to track blockers
4. Pair programming on complex issues (#2, #3, #5)

### General Best Practices
- âœ… Read the full issue spec before starting
- âœ… Update issue status as you progress
- âœ… Test incrementally (don't wait until the end)
- âœ… Document as you go
- âœ… Ask for help early if blocked
